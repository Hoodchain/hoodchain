Hoodchain 

Hoodchain is a blockcahin created to get minorities involved in blockchain technology. Historically, minority groups are greatly disproportioned in the area of technology and wealth due to the financial structure of the system. Our goal is to create a blockchain that minority groups will be involved in building and advancing to gain knowledge in this new and emerging technology and to also incentivise them with a system of wealth for their participation and gained knowledge.

We all know that poorer areas, generally known as the "Hoods" and the "ghettos" are greatly behind in the area of new and emerging technology. This is because they have a much harder time even accessing the knowledge to be involved in these technologies, as well as their schools generally do offer anything in the areas of technology because they usually attention schools who don't the budgets to incorporate these technologies in their curriculum. Generally, the generation previous of them have manual labor or low paying jobs and they were denied any training or knowledge on the new and emerging technologies of their time, which cuases a revolving scycle. Our goal is to break that
